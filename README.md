# VoteMaster

## Overview

VoteMaster is a prototype that evaluates alternative designs for a direct democracy application, specifically referendum management. It is not the final application. Initially, it will use SQL as a backend for testing. The final application will use different strategies and technologies, including interaction with a blockchain backend. Instead of using tools like Figma, we are using C# and JavaScript for greater flexibility. Ultimately, this is just a prototype.
